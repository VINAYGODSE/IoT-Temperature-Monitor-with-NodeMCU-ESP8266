# IoT-Temperature-Monitor-with-NodeMCU-ESP8266
Build a system that uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 to read temperature from a sensor (e.g., DHT11) and send it to a serial monitor or a basic web server. This demonstrates embedded C programming, IoT communication, and real-time data handling—skills transferable to Zoho’s “high-volume, low-latency applications” requirement.
